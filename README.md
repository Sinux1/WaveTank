# WaveTank
Wave Tank wave generator code for Tablet to control Raspberry Pi GPIO pins -> Eventually I will also have the arduinio code available.
The Pi will receive data from tablet wirelessly, then evaluate that data, subsequently sending appropriate signals to arduino, which will in turn controll a motor for a wave tank.
