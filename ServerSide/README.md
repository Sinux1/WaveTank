For the wave tank, the raspberry Pi to be used must be configured to broadcast it's own router signal, and to do this upon boot.
To avoid having to manually login and start the application, which would require a monitor and keyboard, use chrontab to begin application on boot also. Instructions for doing so will be eventually uploaded, but I have finals soon and my Physics professor also decided to schedula an exam the week before them (shout out Jorstad!)
 ***I have since lost the link to the instructions I found for making the RPi a wireless router, but quick Google search and I found something that if not the instructions I used, are very close and should work the same albeit with a few minor changes ***
