# Client Side
This GUI is very basic, I have no idea how to use CSS yet, I apologize. The voltages put out by the PWM pin have never been measured and still need to be tested, and are likely incorrect so the code will need to be changed, but that shold not be terribly difficult and I am available for questions. 
Commenting could be clearer, but that will need to wait.
The device that this application is to be run must connect to the 'wireless router' that is the raspberry pi. Set it to connect automatically and power up the Pi first. 
I will look into figuring out how to poll the connection automatically looking for a connection, but for now, do not run the app until the Pi is up and ready.
